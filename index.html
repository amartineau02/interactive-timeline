          <p>Ghosts, spirits, abandoned barns and homes -- what does all of this mean? Is there a story?

          Massachusetts is one of the oldest states to join the United States. The home of the pilgrims and Wompanoag is also home to many, many haunting and eerie stories. Some of these stories have a history dating back to the early 1600s. Massachusetts Historic Hauntings is where you can find 12 of the most interesting, most historical ghost stories of the Bay State.</p>

              <h2>Rehoboth Village Cemetery</h2>
              <p>It’s 2019. This year, the town of Rehoboth, MA has turned 375 years old. You’ve spent the day on Route 44, watching the parade and celebrating the history of the small farm town. Once night falls, you pack your things and head home for the day, turning left onto Bay State Road. Going up the hill, you near one of the oldest living landmarks of the town -- the Olde Rehoboth Village Cemetery. As you drive by, you hear a scream, followed by echoing laughter. A man stands in the cemetery, his eye sockets dark and empty.</p>
              <p>This particular phantom has been wandering the cemeteries for ages, even into the modern days. His name is unknown, but he appears to be wearing eighteenth-century clothing and is primarily found in the southwestern corner of the grounds. It’s been recorded that these sightings can range from seeing his apparition on the horizon in front of a stone to him chasing after a car and banging on the car windows. He targets women especially, and sometimes he’s apparition has been seen beating a woman. (It is believed he may have bludgeoned a woman to death in his lifetime.) Along with this, do not ever, ever say “Catherine”. He yells this name with a particular hatred and spews vulgarities with it.</p>

              <h2>Anawan Rock</h2>
              <p>Today, you decide to enjoy a nice walk through nature. One of the short trails in Rehoboth, MA is located just off of Route 44 by the name of Anawan Rock. You park your car and head down the short path, but something’s off. The smell of smoke is in the air, almost like a campfire, but you were just on the main road. There’s no one even remotely close by with something like that. As you step closer to the giant rock, looking at all of the carvings, you hear whispers, voices. It seems to change direction every time you turn. What these voices are saying, you can’t tell, but it’s still enough to make your skin crawl.</p>
              <p>Early in America’s history was King Philip’s War, a fight that took place between the newcomers to New England and the Native American tribes that lived there previously. Anawan was a Wampanoag chief. In 1676, he was captured by Captain Benjamin Church. Anawan could have fought, but he trusted Church’s promise that he and his people would be treated fairly upon surrender. Soon after, once Anawan was brought to Plymouth, he was executed, along with the small group of natives he had with him. Him and his tribe are said to linger around this rock, sometimes saying “Iootash”, meaning “stand and fight” an Algonquin. It’s almost as if his spirit remains there, regretting that he surrendered to the Colonists.</p>

              <h2>The Curse of Giles Corey</h2>
              <p>Salem, home to many stories of witches and warlocks and devilish creatures and ghosts alike. It’s not uncommon to feel like you’re not alone in that city, particularly when you’re close to a graveyard. As you pass the Howard Street Cemetery, you can only hope that you don’t run into the apparition of Giles Corey. The curse lingers and brings terrible things to the town of Salem.</p>
              <p>Giles Corey was one of the most famous names that bounced around the Salem Witch Trials. He was a mean, successful farmer, known for agreeing with the many accusations of witchcraft. He even accused his own wife of witchcraft. However, when the tables turned and he was accused, Corey’s belief in it crumbled. Corey was spiteful and clever. He stayed silent when he could, never plead guilty or innocent, and even tricked the court into thinking they were going to get lots of land upon his death. Corey was pressed to death in public, and that death is what really made the community think about the witch trials and start to move on from it. It’s believed his ghost remains near the cemetery where his body may be (the exact location is uncertain), though there is a curse along with it. Any sighting marked of Giles Corey’s apparition can mean only one thing: something bad is going to happen to Salem in the near future.</p>

              <p>Staying at a place as gorgeous as the Old Yarmouth Inn should be a relaxing and refreshing experience. What more could you expect from spending time on the Cape? Though, maybe you wouldn’t expect to be alone in your room and feel the bed shift with the weight of someone sitting beside you. Seeing no one, you hide under the blankets, firmly tucking the edges around yourself to feel safe and secure. Despite this, your feet get cold, almost as if hands are grabbing them. Not responding to this doesn’t seem to please the ghost. The bed starts to rattle and shake from the footer bedposts.</p>
              <p>The Old Yarmouth Inn was established in the late 1600s. Being so old, it’s booming with paranormal activity. The new owners originally did not believe in anything supernatural until they purchased the establishment. While there’s no telling who the spirits are in particular, but from the list of sightings and odd happenings, at least they don’t appear violent. They’re merely playful, trying to poke fun at the current living.</p>

              <p>While visiting the historic sites around Boston, you decide to travel to the Boston Light. Despite the day being bright and sunny, once you arrive on the property, there’s a few noticeable spots of cold. Sometimes at a quick glance you think you spot someone walking up in the lantern room, but they disappear only moments later.</p>
              <p>The Boston Light, built in 1716, is the oldest lighthouse in America. The island of Little Brewster where it sits is home to many legends and tragedies (including shipwrecks and the drowning of keepers). Of course it has the basics of supernatural occurrences, such as apparitions and cold spots, but there’s more than meets the eye. A couple miles east of the island is a place known as the “Ghost Walk”. No sound ever reaches this part of the ocean, not even the horn of the Boston Light, or numerous foghorn signals that were used once in a study. The cause for this remains unexplained.</p>

              <h2>The Stormbreeder</h2>
              <p>You’re walking through Providence, Rhode Island. The sky is growing dark, a storm is looming on the horizon. People walk hurriedly through the streets to seek shelter. Suddenly, amongst the sounds of city life, you hear a very distinct beat. Hoofbeats, and they’re getting louder, right along with the downpour. Just as the sound (and a black figure) gallop by you, the storm picks up, just enough that you can barely see them. Moments later, the apparition is gone. All that remains is city life and rain.</p>
              <p>A man by the name of Peter Rugg was a resident of Boston. Him and his family were average. The only thing that stood out about them was the fact that Mr. Rugg could have quite a temper. Mr. Rugg and his young daughter went to Concord via horse and carriage to take care of business. By the end of the night, they went to a tavern, where the man had a drink with a long-time friend. During the time they were in the tavern, a terrible thunderstorm made its way over the area. The tavern owner begged Mr. Rugg to stay the night with his daughter, stating that it would be safer, but Mr. Rugg’s temper got the best of him. He took his daughter, saddled up, and rode out of Concord. That was the last time anyone saw the two of them alive. Since then, his ghost has been reported being seen from Concord, MA to Hartford, CT.</p>

              <h2>New England's Dark Day</h2>
              <p>It’s the late 1700s in New England. Everyone is on a constant edge with the ongoing revolution. You never know when war is going to strike in your backyard. It’s a perfectly sunny day and you go about your regular business despite storm clouds forming in the distance. By noon, the sky is black. Darker than night black. Before long, visibility is a mere few inches. Children are sent home from schools. Men and women flock to taverns and churches to find solace and seek forgiveness.</p>
              <p>As fictional as this sounds, this event most certainly occurred, as found and recorded in multiple journals and poems. During the time of war and death, people believed that this was God’s making, and that judgement day was finally there to take them all. Now that we’re in the twenty-first century and have technology and more scientific views, we’re able to find what is probable to be the real cause behind this. The day may have started off bright and sunny, but anyone from New England knows that can change in a matter of minutes. Clouds and heavy fog played a role in this. The intense darkness is being linked to a large wildfire that took place in Canada at roughly the same time. These three things mixed together to completely block sunlight from view.</p>

              <p>The Shad Factory Pond in Rehoboth is a very peaceful site. The blue water surrounded by New England nature and suburban homes could bring just about anyone to a sense of comfort. While walking around the pond, you decide to visit another site under the same name: the Shad Factory Mill. Once arriving at the mill, or what’s left of it, your mood diminishes. You feel like you’re being watched. There’s overwhelming anxiety and sadness. Deciding it’s too much, you make the decision to leave and head back towards the pond. You don’t leave without seeing a quick glimpse of a hooded man who vanishes just as quickly as he appeared.</p>
              <p>The Shad Factory Mill was built in 1810 and has been listed under a few different names. For some time it was the Palmer River Manufacturing Company, then the Orleans Manufacturing Company, and eventually the Shad Factory Mill. In 1826 it was expanded from its original size. In 1831 there was a fire that destroyed most of it, but the mill was able to be rebuilt. In 1884 another fire claimed the building, completely destroying it and bringing it to the ground. To this day the ruins are an eerie, overgrown place, known to have phantom fires, white orbs of light, screams, and apparitions.</p>

With the windows closed it almost looks abandoned. You decide to walk close to it. That’s when you start to hear voices, like class behind held. Surely there couldn’t be class, so you decide to peer into the crack of the shudders to look inside. You make eye contact with a woman. She glares at you, as if upset that you’ve disturbed her class. She vanishes before you can even look away.</p>
              <p>The town of Rehoboth (mentioned a few times throughout this site), among other things, is known as being the “Birthplace of Public Education” in America. It opened up the first school in 1643. The most famous of them all was built in 1845 under the name Hornbine. It only stopped being used at a school in 1937. Since then, it has been open to schools (and the public by appointment) for short tours.</p>

              <p>When visiting Boston, there’s plenty of options for staying the night. Hotels, bed & breakfasts, and taverns scatter the city. Upon arriving to your choice (the Omni Parker House), you are given the key to your room, all the way up on the 10th floor. You gather your belongings and head to the elevator. Being the only ones going for the ride, you assume it’s going to be a quick ride straight to the top, so it comes as a surprise to you when the elevator stops and opens at the third floor with no one waiting on the other side. Passing this off as some glitch, you stay in the elevator until you reach your floor and head down the hall to your room. During your stay, you experience a few supernatural occurrences. Orbs of white light, vague apparitions -- and even the apparition of a man dressed in Victorian era clothing standing at the foot of your bed.</p>
              <p>The Omni Parker House, once known as the Parker House, is the longest continuously operated hotel in America. Over the years, its welcomed thousands of guests, and some of them have had known-names. Names like Henry David Thoreau, John Wilkes Booth, Madonna, Ulysses S. Grant, and many, many more. It’s no question as to how this is haunted. It’s who is haunting it that’s the question. Some believe the apparitions appearing at people’s beds is Mr. Parker himself. Others believe that the haunting on Room 303 is haunted by a liquor salesman.</p>

You take a tour of the place, learning about the gruesome homicide that took place within these walls, and somehow you still decide you’re calm enough to spend the night.

Both victims were found in their home axed to death, to the point they were barely recognizable. The step-mother was nearly decapitated. It became famous in the town of Fall River. All fingers pointed to Lizzie, but since the evidence was not enough to prove her guilty, she was acquitted. She lived the rest of her life under a different name in a different home, and was later buried in the family plot. The house was privately owned for some time, but it is now owned by a couple and used as a bed and breakfast as well as museum. Visitors are able to take a tour, and if they dare, even sleep in the beds of the victims (including where the stepmother was axed).</p>

While there, you learn a brief history of it and get yourself accustomed to the very nautical interior decorating throughout. Though, even as early as dinner, a strange thing happens. A large ship wheel starts to move on its own. People stand to fix it, but once they walk away, it continues as if they didn’t even touch it. You discuss this strange phenomena with some  of the workers and learn that even stranger things have happened, like a worker finding all of the tables and chairs facing the opposite direction that he placed them.

The original building was finished in 1766, but it was destroyed and reconstructed. Built in the heart of Salem, there’s no doubting why it became a place for meetings and headquarters. The Salem Marine Society made its home here (which would explain the nautical decor). People believe that the place is haunted by old sea captains and visitors to the hotel.</p>
